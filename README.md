# How to collaborate
1. Install [Twine](https://twinery.org/)   
2. Create a test story and find out where on your drive it is saved (should be Documents/Twine/Stories. If on Windows, may be OneDrive/Documents/Twine/Stories.)   
3. Clone this repository INTO the "Stories" folder found above.   
4. If adding new Twine HTML stories, make sure the files start with FairyQuest.   
5. If adding new media (images, audio, video, models), add it to FairyQuest_Media. Files in that folder don't have to start with FairyQuest.
